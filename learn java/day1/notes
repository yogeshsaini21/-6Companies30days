Features of Java

Simple:- Java is easy to learn and its syntax is quite simple, clean and easy to
understand.

Object-Oriented:- Java is object-oriented, it supports all the OOPS
characteristics. This makes java applications easy to develop and maintain,
compared to structured programming language.

Portable and Platform Independent:- Java source code is compiled and
converted into bytecode. this bytecode can run on multiple platforms i.e. Write Once
and Run Anywhere(WORA), we can compile the java code in one Operating
System and execute it on another Operating System.

Secure:- JAVA has provided an implicit component inside JVM in the form of a
“Security Manager”  to provide implicit security against malicious code. Java has
provided very good predefined implementations for almost all well-known network
security. JAVA has provided a separate middleware service in JAAS [Java
Authentication and Authorization Service], which provides web security. Auth, SSO.

Robust:- Robust means strong. Java is having a very good memory management
system in the form of a heap memory management system, it is a dynamic memory
management system, it allocates and deallocates memory for the objects at
runtime. JAVA is having very good Exception Handling mechanisms, because, Java
has provided a very good predefined library to represent and handle almost all the
frequently generated exceptions in java applications.

Multithreaded:- Java supports multithreading to enhance performance. by using
this we can execute multiple functionalities simultaneously.
